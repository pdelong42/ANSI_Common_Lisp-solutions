; The sub-expressions, (- 5 1) and (+ 3 7), are each evaluated first (their
; results probably pushed onto a stack as each is evaluated in-turn), and then
; the larger expression is evaluated (probably by popping the previous results
; off of the aforementioned stack).

; Since "3" is not a list, by itself, the enclosing "and" evaluates as "nil"
; (presumably to be pushed on the stack); next the numbers "1" and "2" are

; from this value and the previous one it pops off the stack.
